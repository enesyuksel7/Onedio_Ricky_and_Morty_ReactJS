## How to run the project?

First, you must enter the following commands in the terminal in order:

### `npm install --force`

First, the specified command is written to the console and all the necessary libraries are installed. The reason why we use the "force" structure is for the strong installation of all libraries without getting stuck with device and internet problems.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Results

In this project, the "onedio-tech" task, which is the result of the Onedio JavaScript Bootcamp, has been developed. React infrastructure was used in the project.

The main tasks performed are as follows:
* The project was built with React and JavaScript programming language, which is one of the most widely used software packages of JavaScript.
* All characters can be listed on the main screen.
* The desired parameters can be filtered with the filtering buttons.
* With the “Show More” button, other cards can be added under a certain number of cards.
* In the writing of the codes, attention was paid to the simple and clean code principle.
* An explanation line has been added to the places that are not understood or have errors.

Other requested tasks are as follows:
* Care has been taken to have a mobile-friendly design.
* Checked multi-browser support by opening it in Chrome and Opera browsers
* Error management has been followed in the codes so that API and network errors can be displayed.
* In case of a problem in one of the APIs, the available parts of the page are working and are protected by "non-breaking pages" error management.
* In the README.md file, the installation and running stages of the project will be explained.
* Private repo named “onedio-tech” has been uploaded to GitHub platform.

What I did in the bonus episode:
* “Lazy load of images” method has been applied for uploading photos.
* The app has been deployed to the Netlify environment and is viewable.
* Care has been taken to make the design only with Tailwind CSS, without using CSS.
